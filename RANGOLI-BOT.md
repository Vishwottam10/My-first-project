# ABSTRACT:

**As a rising art form of the twenty first century, traditional forms of painting has gained acceptance as a two-dimensional art form, in the world of art. In spite of the creation of realistic application software for digital painting, traditional forms of painting like Rangoli is yet to be explored as a visual art form. The pith of this paper is to present a design that can cultivate thought, development and improvement of techno-tasteful values to mimic the human way of perception from viewing and drawing based on human modeling of Rangoli. The methodological strategies as discussed in this paper comprise an optical feedback perception based on camera input and an open source software framework for agent processing. Movements of the agent can be dynamically defined trough an intelligent interface and are performed by the agent in a responsive manner. Controlling behavior of intelligent agent keeps the dynamism manifested by the human behavior, granting spontaneous and dynamic perception of drawing in synchronism to perception from viewing, without any previous knowledge of it.**
