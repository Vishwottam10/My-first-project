# RANGOLI BOT


Most human work on visual input and process data depending on the visual input of the surrounding, People are not equipped with large number of
sensors rather the visual input are processed in a intelligent manner to get the most sophisticated application or uses of human ideas and thoughts.
Visual representation is an age old process where it is used for learning, teaching and expressing once mind or thinking to another person. In this
system we tried to extend a very specific form of art i.e. Rangoli



As the ideas and technologies develop, itâ€™s clear that
drawing robots can be serious indeed. The development of service robot became popular recently due to the fact that society needs robots to relax
human from the tedious, exhaustive physical efforts and time consuming job. Recent generations of robots has even more resemble to humans like
drawing and artistic capacities as a hand drawn painting does not have the required looks as desired. This motivated researchers to design interactive
drawing robots that can mimic the complexity and style of human modeling of Rangoli by applying Computer Aided Rangoli mechanism. The
project places emphasis on outdoor painting, a domestic application using small robots.
